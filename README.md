# 📊 Network Health Dashboard
A simple yet effective web-based dashboard built with Flask and Chart.js to monitor network health metrics. This project provides real-time insights into server latencies and bandwidth usage, designed for IT support and network administrators.

# 🚀 Features
**Real-Time Latency Monitoring**: Displays server latencies with a bar chart.
**Bandwidth Tracking**: Visualizes bytes sent and received over time using a line chart.
**Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile views.
**Lightweight and Fast**: Powered by Flask on the backend and Chart.js for data visualization.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
**Backend**: Flask (Python)
**Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
**Charts**: Chart.js
**Styling**: Custom CSS with a sleek modern design
